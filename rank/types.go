// Package rank is a leaderboard service: submit a score, read a page, read one
// owner's rank, archive a season.
//
// It is a reimplementation rather than a port. The implementation it replaces
// had, among others, these defects — each of which shapes a decision here:
//
//   - A page request with Limit == 0 was translated to ZREVRANGE 0 -1, reading
//     the whole board and fetching one payload per member. It was reachable
//     from a single client packet on a path that never defaulted the field.
//   - Ranks and scores came from two to four unsynchronized reads, so an entry
//     could be shown with a new score at its old rank, and offset paging
//     drifted under concurrent submits.
//   - Accumulating submits used add-mode with the version guard skipped, so a
//     redelivered event added the same delta up to twenty times. The
//     leaderboard was then permanently wrong with no repair path.
//   - Season archiving stopped at the first short page and wrote metadata
//     claiming a complete count. Since the archive is the only record after a
//     reset, that was silent permanent data loss.
//   - The tiebreak field was never populated by any producer, so equal scores
//     were ordered by owner id: a lower id outranked a higher one forever.
//   - The package defined no error codes, so "board id is empty" reached the
//     client as an internal server error.

//   - An error this package cannot classify reports errcode.CodeInternal, not
//     a code of its own. Answering "the store failed" for an unclassified bug
