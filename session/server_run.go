// A run that lapsed holds external resources — a scene, a replica — and
// nothing else releases them, so this cadence is the difference between a
// deadline that means something and a deadline that is a decoration. The
// implementation this replaces computed a deadline, stored it, sent it to
// clients, and never compared it to a clock anywhere.

// run resolves expired runs until the process is shutting down.
//
// It is hand-written because the work is this service's own: which owners to
// sweep is a question only the caller can answer — the sweep takes an owner
// list, because scanning every owner in the store is the unbounded read this
// repository exists to remove.
//
// That is also why this implementation sweeps nothing by default and says so:
// a deployment supplies the owner set, and until it does, expired runs are
// resolved lazily by the next Enter from the same owner (see resolveClaim).
// Lazy resolution is correct but only fires when that owner comes back, so a
// deployment that wants resources released promptly wires the list here.
