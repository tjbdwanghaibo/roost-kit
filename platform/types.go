// Package platform is the channel-facing edge: it turns a channel credential
// into a session, and a payment provider's callback into exactly one delivery.
//
// It is a small package guarding two of the highest-consequence paths in a
// game service, and the implementation it replaces got both wrong:
//
//   - Session minting had no authentication at all. `AuthSession` took a
//     player id out of the request body and signed a token for it. Anyone who
//     could reach the endpoint could obtain a valid session for any player.
//     There was no credential, no channel check, nothing to verify — so this
//     package requires a Verifier with no default, the same way account does:
//     the absence of a check must not be able to look like a default.
//
//   - Recharge delivery was stateless and not idempotent. The callback was
//     signature-verified and then handed straight to the deliverer. The
//     `RequestID` field was accepted, forwarded, and never used — not for
//     dedupe, not for correlation, not even in a log line. A signature proves
//     the payload came from the provider; it does not prove this is the first
//     time it arrived. So replaying a captured callback, or a redelivery from
//     the at-least-once transport in front of it, delivered the goods again.
//     The only dedupe was in the game process three hops away, keyed on an
//     order id it happened to also receive.
//
//     Here an order is a durable, insert-only record, and delivery is
//     reserve-before-deliver: the reservation is what makes the second arrival
//     a replay instead of a second grant. A signature that verifies is
//     necessary and not sufficient.
//
// And two smaller ones: the error from a failed delivery was discarded and
// replaced with a constant string, so a payment that failed to deliver left no
// trace on the server at all; and the callback response was the deliverer's
// response passed through unchanged, so a caller could not tell a platform
// refusal from a game refusal.
