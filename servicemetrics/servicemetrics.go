// Package servicemetrics is the reporting seam every service in this
// repository uses.
//
// Why a package rather than a convention: constraint 6 of the repository's
// design rules requires every service to report queue depth, compare-and-set
// conflict rate and drop counts. Five of the first six services were written
// without any reporting at all, by an author who had read the constraint —
// which is the same lesson the six defect patterns teach. A shared seam makes
// the omission visible: a service that does not take a Reporter has nowhere to
// put one.
//
// Every path that drops something, refuses something or loses a
// compare-and-set reports it. Those are precisely the paths that were silent
// in the implementations being replaced: a cancel that answered OK while the
// store said matched, an archive that truncated at the first short page, a
// notification refused with no audit. None of them were discoverable in
// production because none of them emitted anything.
package servicemetrics

// Reporter receives service events.
//
// The methods are named after the event rather than taking a metric name,
// because a mistyped name is a metric nobody sees. Adding an event is a
// compile error at every implementation, which is the point: a new silent
// path cannot be introduced without someone deciding how it is observed.
//
// A nil Reporter means "no reporting" and is never a reason for an operation
// to fail. Use Wrap to get a nil-safe value.

	Refused(op, reason string)

	// than applied again. A rising rate means the transport is redelivering.
	Replayed(op string)
