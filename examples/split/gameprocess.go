// GameProcess wires a process that CALLS mail without owning it.
//
// The only difference from MailProcess is which mail Mod it registers:
//
//	owner:  mail.NewMod(...)        + mail.NewServer() as the app.Service
//	caller: mail.NewClientMod(...)  + its own app.Service
//
// Both Mods publish the same capability name and the same interface type, so
// consumer.go is byte-identical in the two processes. That is the whole
// deliverable of this design: which services share a process is a deployment
// decision, and it is expressed here and nowhere else.
//
// Registering BOTH in one process fails at startup — they publish the same
// name and the registry refuses the second. A process cannot end up holding a
// local service and a client to itself with the winner decided by
// registration order.

			// this example is about the mail side.

//	                       # waiting on a process that may never answer
//
// It has no key_prefix and no send_ttl, because a client has no store. A
// caller therefore cannot be misconfigured with a prefix that disagrees with
// the owner's: there is no prefix here to disagree.
