// Package directory is the reserve/commit/cancel primitive behind globally
// unique names and exclusive membership.
//
// Two independent implementations of this idea in one business repository had
// the same three defects, all of which this contract makes unrepresentable:
//
//   - The reservation and the record it protects were written to two stores
//     with no transaction, and the compensating release dropped its error. A
//     crash between the writes burned the name permanently: reserved to an
//     owner that does not exist, and unreleasable by any code path.
//   - A second write path (an "upsert" API) bypassed reservation entirely, so
//     the same name could be taken twice and a rename orphaned the old
//     reservation.
//   - Release compared the owner and then deleted in a separate round trip, so
//     a release racing a re-reservation deleted the new owner's claim.
//
// The shape here is a two-phase claim over versioned state: Reserve takes the
// key for one owner and returns a claim, Commit makes it permanent, Cancel
// releases it. A reservation carries the owner and an expiry, so an abandoned
// claim frees itself instead of burning the key forever — the failure mode
// that has no recovery path.
//
// What it deliberately does not offer: a way to write an entry without going
// through Reserve. There is no Set.
