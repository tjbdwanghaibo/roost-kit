// Package mail is the mailbox service: envelopes with optional attachments,
// per-player read/claim state, and the three-phase claim that hands an
// attachment to a caller exactly once.
//
// The implementation this replaces had four defects that shaped this design:
//
//   - The claim idempotency key came from the client. `ClaimRequest.RequestID`
//     was whatever the caller sent, and the reservation could be taken over
//     once its lease elapsed. So a caller whose commit response was lost could
//     retry with a NEW request id, win the reservation, and be handed the
//     attachment a second time — the goods were already in the player's
//     inventory. The only thing standing between that and a duplicate grant
//     was a dedupe table three hops away in the game process.
//
//     Here the claim token is minted by the service and is CONSTANT for one
//     (player, mail) pair. A retry cannot produce a different key, so a
//     delivery side that dedupes on it converges no matter how many times the
//     caller retries or how long it waits.
//
//   - Listing was O(n) round trips with no bound on the round trips. `List`
//     clamped how many items it RETURNED, then looped fetching pages of
//     `limit*4` envelopes and issued one state read per envelope, continuing
//     until it had filled the page. A player with many deleted mails made one
//     protocol packet into an unbounded number of database calls. Here the
//     bound is on the work, not just the output: one envelope page plus one
//     mailbox read, and the mailbox is a single versioned entry.
//
//   - The unread count was an unbounded aggregation. Every summary ran a
//     `$lookup`/`$unwind`/`$group` over every active envelope for that player,
//     and server-wide mail is in that collection for everybody. Here the count
//     lives in the mailbox and moves in the SAME compare-and-set as the status
//     change, so it cannot disagree with the statuses it summarizes.
//
//   - `PlayerID` came from the request body, so any caller could claim another
//     player's attachments. Here the caller identity is a parameter of the
//     service call and is never read out of a request struct.
