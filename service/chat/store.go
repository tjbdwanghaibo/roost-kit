// Store is chat persistence, and it is also where authorization happens.
//
// That placement is deliberate. In the implementation this replaces the
// storage seam validated with trusted = true unconditionally — the trust
// decision was an argument the caller passed, and the only caller passed the
// value that skipped every check. Any future direct user of that seam would
// have silently lost the check. Here there is no trust argument to pass: the
// seam holds the ChannelPolicy and the BodyRegistry and evaluates them on
// every append and every history read, and the privileged append demands a
// SystemToken, which cannot be constructed outside this package.
//
// The retention tradeoff, stated plainly: versionstore has no TTL in its
// contract, and a TTL on versioned state would drop the version along with the
// value. So this package does not claim one. A channel keeps a bounded ring of
// its most recent messages (ChannelRule.Retain, at most MaxRetain), enforced on
// every append with no background job required, plus an age-based Prune an
// operator or a sweep loop calls. The cost is real and is the honest part:
// history older than the ring is gone, and gone permanently — chat here is a
// live feed with a replay window, not an archive. A game that needs an archive
// must tee messages to a log or a warehouse, which is a different service.
// What the ring does buy is that the retained window is also a bound on how
// large one versioned entry can grow, and that a client which fell outside the
// window is *told* so (Page.Gap) instead of silently believing it is current.
type Store interface {
	// Append stores a role's message. It validates the channel against its
	// rule, requires the message type to be registered, bounds the body,
	// requires an idempotency key, and evaluates the channel policy — always,
	// with no way for a caller to ask it not to.
	//
	// from is the session's identity, not something the request carried. A
	// replay of req.RequestID returns the message already stored.
	Append(ctx context.Context, from Sender, req PublishRequest) (Message, error)

	// AppendSystem stores a message from the game itself. It needs a
	// SystemToken, which only GrantSystem mints and no request body can carry.
	//
	// It skips exactly one thing the role path does — the per-role
	// ChannelPolicy, because there is no role — and skips nothing else: the
	// type must still be registered, the body is still bounded, the
	// idempotency key is still required, retention still applies.

	// 1:1 conversation one stream instead of two half-views.

// channelState is one channel's entire mutable state, held as a single

//
// Keeping the sequence in the same entry as the messages is the central
// decision, and it answers two defects at once. The implementation this
// replaces did a find-and-increment on one *global* sequence document and then
// a separate insert: one hot document for the whole service, and an id that
// was allocated by a write which the insert could then fail to use — burning
// the id, or, on a client retry with no idempotency key, storing a second copy
// of the same message under a new id. Here the allocation, the append and the
// idempotency record are one compare-and-set on one channel's entry: either all
// of them happen or none do, and contention is per channel rather than global.

// and thereby skip the policy, the type registry and the bounds the seam
// applies. Wire a backend for it with NewRedisStateStore.
