// Package account is the account and role directory: it maps a channel
// identity to an account, owns the roles under it, and issues role session
// tokens.
//
// This is a rewrite. The implementation it replaces had, among others, these
// defects — and each one is why something here looks the way it does:
//
//   - Login verified nothing. It accepted {channel, open_id} and returned the
//     account, and selecting a role then returned a valid session token for
//     any player under it. The only gate was one repo-wide shared secret
//     whose signature covered the body with no timestamp or nonce, so a
//     captured request replayed forever — and in a non-production
//     configuration with no secret set the gate was off entirely. That is
//     full account takeover. Here identity verification is a required
//     interface with **no default**: a service that cannot verify does not
//     start.
//   - The default player-id allocator was a per-process counter starting at
//     one, selected whenever Redis was absent but Mongo was not, and role
//     creation wrote with a replace that matched and overwrote an existing
//     document. Restart the service, create a role, and an existing player's
//     record was gone. Here there is no default allocator, and creation is
//     insert-only.
//   - The per-server role limit was a read-count-write with a deliberately
//     non-unique index behind it, so two concurrent creates both passed.
//     Here it is an exclusive claim in the directory primitive.
//   - A separate upsert entry point bypassed name reservation, account
//     existence and the role limit, and would reparent a role to another
//     account or rename it while orphaning the old reservation. There is no
//     such entry point here; each mutation is a narrow, constrained operation.
//   - Name reservation and the role record were two collection writes with no
//     transaction, and the compensating release dropped its error, so a crash
//     between them burned the name permanently. Here reservation is the
//     two-phase claim in the directory package: an uncommitted claim expires.
//   - Redis role updates compared a re-marshalled value against stored bytes,
//     so adding one field wedged every role write across a rolling deploy.
//     Here state goes through versionstore, which compares versions.
