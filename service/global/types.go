// Package global is the cross-server coordination service: it owns which
// global group a game server belongs to, and the liveness lease each game
// server holds.
//
// The business boundary document of the implementation this replaces already
// wrote down the invariants this package must hold — "route binding migration
// must use epoch CAS, not an in-process lock", "aggregation and participant
// progress must use a CAS store". They were conventions, and the
// implementation did not keep them:
//
//   - Every store exposed both an unconditional SetXxx and a read-modify-write
//     UpdateXxx. The Redis implementation's Update used compare-and-set; the
//     DAO-backed implementation's Update read and then wrote unconditionally.
//     Both satisfied the same interface, so the type system could not tell
//     them apart and whichever was configured decided whether the documented
//     invariant held. Four stores, one shape.
//   - The game lease store had no compare-and-set path at all. Its heartbeat
//     read the record, computed a next version from it, and wrote
//     unconditionally — the version field was decorative. Concurrent
//     heartbeats overwrote each other, and a late heartbeat from a previous
//     game incarnation could overwrite an active lease with its own start
//     time and load, because nothing checked that the writer was still the
//     holder.
//
// Here the invariants are held by the types. State goes through
// versionstore, whose contract has no unconditional write, so a non-CAS
// implementation cannot exist. And the lease carries an incarnation token that
// a renewal must present, so a writer that is no longer the holder is refused
// rather than silently winning.
