// SweepInterval is how often the activity process back-stops aggregations
// whose grace window has closed, and retries dispatches that failed.
//
// This cadence is what makes the grace window real. The window is the only
// thing that finishes an activity when a game server never notifies — and this
// service deliberately never advances an activity from its own CLOCK, only
// from a game's notification plus an expired window it already started. So an
// AdvanceExpired nobody calls means an activity that one silent game server
// leaves collecting forever, with every other game blocked on the result.
const SweepInterval = 20 * time.Second

// SweepBatch bounds one sweep of a group's expired activities, and
// DispatchBatch bounds how many due dispatches are retried per activity.
// A backlog is worked through in bounded steps rather than one unbounded pass.

// run advances expired activities and retries due dispatches until the process
// is shutting down.
//
// It works the groups sweepGroups reports. There is no way to enumerate groups
// without an unbounded scan of the keyspace, and putting such a scan on a
// timer is the shape this repository removes — so a deployment supplies them,
// which it can, because a group is a deployment fact.
//
// The two halves are ordered deliberately: advancing an activity is what
// CREATES its dispatches, so advancing first means a result becomes deliverable
// in the same tick it was aggregated rather than the next one.
//
// A failure is logged and left for the next tick rather than returned:
// returning would take the process down, turning one stuck activity into an
// outage for every other. ErrDispatchNotDue is expected and not an error — the
// backoff has not elapsed — and ErrDispatchExhausted is logged at error level
// because it is terminal: a game server will not receive its result from any
// retry, and only a human can decide what that means for the activity.
