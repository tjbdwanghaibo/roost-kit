// boundary document already said what the shape had to be — "participant
// progress 必须先通过 request ledger CAS reserve 再更新参与者积分/进度" — so
// this is two steps that cannot be collapsed:
//
//  1. Reserve. An insert-only Create on the ledger claims the right to apply.
//     Insert-only, not "read then write if absent": a read-then-write claim
//     hands the right to both of two concurrent callers, which is the double
//     count with extra steps.
//  2. Apply. One compare-and-set moves the score and records the request id in
//     the participant's bounded ring together, so the record of having applied
//     cannot exist without the apply, and vice versa.
//
// A replayed request id is a no-op that returns the participant's current
// state: an applied reservation short-circuits before the participant store is
// touched, and if the reservation is still merely reserved — the caller that
// claimed it lost the race to get here, or died between the two steps — the
// apply is re-driven and the ring makes it a no-op. There is no interleaving
// of a redelivery that counts twice.
//
// The request id is not trusted as an identity, only as an idempotency key,
// and it is scoped by activity and participant so it cannot address another
// participant's progress. It is client-chosen, which design constraint 4
// allows exactly because it is reserved through this ledger rather than
