// The transport for Coordinator is generated from the interface below.
//
//go:generate go run github.com/tjbdwanghaibo/roost-codegen/cmd/servicerpc -dir .

// Coordinator is the cross-process contract: what ANOTHER process may ask of
// the activity coordination service.
//
// Five of the fourteen Service methods are not here, in two groups.
//
// AdvanceExpired, DueDispatches and AttemptDispatch are the owning process's
// own periodic work: back-stopping an aggregation whose grace window closed,
// and retrying a dispatch whose delivery failed. They are what the Server's
// run hook drives. Exposing them would let any process on the bus advance
// activities it does not own, on a cadence nobody configured.
//
// NotifyAudits and AuditOverflow are the diagnostic surface: why was this
// game's notification refused, and how many audits were dropped. They answer
// an operator's question, not a game's, and they belong with the operator
// tools rather than on the path a game server calls in a loop.
//
// Every method carries an affinity key derived from the group, and that is the
// load-bearing decision here rather than a tuning choice. A group's PENDING
// WINDOW is one versioned entry — it is what bounds the group's open
// activities and what OpenActivity must be admitted through — so every
// activity in a group commits through the same compare-and-set. Round-robin
// routing across replicas turns that into cross-replica contention on one key.
// Routing by group keeps it in one process, the same reason match routes by
// queue.
//
// The key is Key.Group() rather than Key.String(): routing per ACTIVITY would
// spread one group's window traffic across instances, which is the contention
// this is meant to avoid, and is the mistake that looks correct because the
// activity is the more obvious unit.
