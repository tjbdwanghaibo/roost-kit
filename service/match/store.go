// The shape that matters: Commit is one call that takes tickets off the queue,
// creates the match and resolves those tickets **atomically**. There is no way
// to pop the queue without committing, and no way to write a match without
// consuming its tickets. In the implementation this replaces those were three
// separate writes with the queue already truncated, so a failure between them
// lost the players — removed from the queue, still marked waiting, with
// nothing to put them back.
