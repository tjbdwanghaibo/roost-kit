// Package match is matchmaking: subjects queue for a mode, the service groups
// them, and a group becomes a match exactly once.
//
// This is a redesign, not a port. The implementation it replaces had ten
// severe defects and — decisively — no production caller for its queue half,
// so there was no migration pressure to preserve its shape. Each decision
// here answers one of those defects:
//
//   - Ticket ids came off the wire and were used verbatim as identity, with no
//     per-subject uniqueness check. One client could queue the same player
//     twice and have it committed into two matches, or into one match twice.
//     Here the service mints ids, and a subject may hold one live ticket.
//   - Committing a match popped the queue, then wrote the match, then flipped
//     each ticket in a loop. A failure anywhere after the pop lost those
//     players: gone from the queue, still "waiting", with no reaper. Here the
//     commit is a single atomic step and the queue is only mutated by it.
//   - The version used for optimistic writes was a process-local counter
//     starting at one, so versions from different replicas — and from the same
//     replica after a restart — were incomparable, and a stale write was
//     dropped while the caller was told it succeeded. Here versions come from
//     the store and a refused write is an error.
//   - Server-generated ids were "ticket-1", "match-1" process sequences, so
//     two replicas minted identical ids and an idempotent enqueue could return
//     another player's ticket.
//   - Cancel, read and close carried no caller identity, over guessable ids.
//     Here every operation naming a ticket also names its subject.
//   - ExpiresAt was written and never read: nothing enforced a timeout. Here
//     expiry is enforced on read and by an explicit sweep.
