	// envelope, in a loop with no bound on the number of iterations. A
	// contract that can only fetch one envelope at a time makes that the

// queue, a lazy backfill on first read, a nightly sweep — and a library that
// picked one would be wrong for the others.
//

// is idempotent per (mailbox, mail): a redelivered mail does not become unread
// twice and does not double the count. So a Deliverer may retry freely.
