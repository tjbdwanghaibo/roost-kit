import "context"

// The transport for Match is generated from the interface below.

//go:generate go run github.com/tjbdwanghaibo/roost-codegen/cmd/servicerpc -dir .

// Matchmaker is the cross-process contract: what ANOTHER process may ask of
// the match service.
//
// Not "Match": this package already has a Match, and it is a formed match —
// the thing the service produces. An interface and a value type of one name in
// one package is how a reader ends up looking at the wrong one, and the
// generator would also have shadowed the Match method with an embedded field
// of the same name.
//
// Every method carries an affinity key derived from the queue, and that is the
// load-bearing decision here rather than a tuning choice. The whole queue
// state is one versioned entry — which is what makes a group commit a single
// compare-and-set — so throughput on one queue is bounded by contention on one
// key. Round-robin routing across replicas turns that bound into cross-replica
// contention, and it is the DESIGN CAUSE of the contention the implementation
// this replaces suffered, not a performance problem it had. Routing a queue's
// traffic to one instance keeps the contention in one process.
//
// Sweep is not here: resolving expired tickets is the owning process's own
// periodic work, and it belongs in the Server's run hook.
