// Package activity is the cross-server activity coordination service:
// aggregating a phase advance (close, settle, ...) across the game servers
// that take part in one activity, the per-participant progress those servers
// report, and the delivery of the aggregated result back to them.
//
// The business boundary document of the implementation this replaces stated
// the rules below as conventions. They were not kept, and three of the gaps
// were confirmed by reading that implementation:
//
//   - Every store exposed both an unconditional SetXxx and a read-modify-write
//     UpdateXxx. The Redis implementation's Update used compare-and-set; the
//     DAO-backed one's Update read and then wrote unconditionally. Both
//     satisfied the same interface, so which one was configured decided
//     whether the documented CAS invariant held. Here every mutation goes
//     through versionstore, whose contract has no unconditional write, so a
//     non-CAS implementation of activity state cannot be written at all.
//   - The notify path had no idempotency, so a redelivered notification
//     double-counted a participant's progress. Here a progress apply must
//     first claim an insert-only reservation in the request ledger, and the
//     apply that follows records the request id in the same compare-and-set
//     that moves the score, so no interleaving of a redelivery can count
//     twice.
//   - Notify audit was documented but written on only some refusal paths.
//     Here a refusal is not something a branch can return: the only
//     expression in this package that produces a notify refusal is
//     refuseNotify, which writes the audit first and fails the call if it
//     cannot. A refusal without an audit is not reachable.
//
// One further rule from that document shapes the API more than anything else:
// "活动开关和阶段推进由各 game 根据本服业务时间线通知，global 不按自身 CloseAt
// 主动驱动活动时间线" — this service never advances an activity from its own
// clock. So an activity opens in StatusPending and stays there indefinitely;
// only a game's notification starts the grace window, and the sweep that
// back-stops the aggregation can only finish a window a game already started.
//
// It lived inside package global until the transport generator made the
// packaging visible: global publishes two capabilities and app.Service is one
// per process, so routing/leases and activity coordination were always two
// deployments sharing one Go package. They share no type and no store.

// Error codes.
//
// Written out rather than derived with iota so a code is a fact about the wire
// and not a fact about the order of const specs.
//
// This package has its own segment. It shared global's when it lived inside
// it, and that sharing left a hole at 570111 that global's segment test had to
// carry as a documented exception — an exception that existed only because two
// services were numbering out of one range.
