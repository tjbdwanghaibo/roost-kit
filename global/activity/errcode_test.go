// The pairing table, the segment's contiguity and its exact count are pinned
// by TestEveryClientMistakeHasItsOwnCode in activity_test.go, which predates
// this file: the error-code assertions were written alongside the service and
// moved with it when the package was split out of global.
//
// What was NOT covered there is what this file adds, and both gaps are the
// kind that only show up at an RPC boundary — which is precisely where this
// package now has one.

// A foreign sentinel this package maps deliberately must NOT fall through to
// the internal code.
//
// This is the gap worth naming. The errors.Is branch for
// versionstore.ErrConflict was WRITTEN when the activity service was split out
// of package global — before the split it borrowed global's Error function —
// and nothing exercised it. Compare-and-set exhaustion under contention is a
// real, retryable outcome a caller can act on; "server error" is not an answer
// it can act on. Every store call in this package goes through versionstore,
// so this is not a rare path.

// The code survives however deeply the error is wrapped, and when two coded
// errors are wrapped together the FIRST one wins.
//
// This package does not currently double-wrap anywhere: refuseNotify uses a
// single %w per branch. The precedence assertion is here anyway, and the
// reason is worth being exact about rather than dressing up as a property the
// code already relies on. It is a GUARD: the day someone writes
// `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ErrStatus, cause)` — which is how the sibling packages
// report a refusal that carries the caller's own reason — the order matters,
// and getting it backwards tells a client why its argument was odd instead of
// that the call was refused. That is a silent wrong answer, not an error, so
// there is nothing to notice later.
